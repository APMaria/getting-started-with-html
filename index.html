<h1> Key Concepts</h1>
<b>Unit 1 Basics of the Web</b>
<p>The web is made up of HTML (Hypertest Markup Language) and hyperlinks and was invented in 1990s with over 30 billion pages.HTML is made up of:<br>Text Content (What you can see) <br> Markup (What it looks like)<br>References to other documents (e.g. images & video)<br>Links to other pages<br>*Note - Plain text is plain text in HTML<br> HTML markups are made up of tags. Some tags have opening and closing tags. Others (Void tags) do not have closing tags. In HTML all "whitespace" (e.g. multiple lines) displays as a single line. Computers are stupid and will only do <em>exactly</em> what you tell them to! A Tag is an HTML that is always contained within angled brackets unless it it a "Void" tag. An element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags. An attribute is the property of an HTML element (e.g. href).</p>
